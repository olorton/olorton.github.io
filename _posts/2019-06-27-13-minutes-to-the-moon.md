I must mention how much I'm enjoying a new podcast from the BBC World Service, 13 Minutes to the Moon. Celebrating 50 years since we took our first steps on the moon, the team tell the story of the people who made Apollo 11 happen and prevented it from going badly wrong. If you don't want to catch up on all of the episodes, I particularly recommend [Ep.05 The fourth astronaut](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csz4dn) which details the extraordinary guidance computer and those that programmed it.
