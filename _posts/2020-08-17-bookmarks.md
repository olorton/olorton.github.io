DONT FORGET - to change the published tag and the date and timezone

I have needed a better solution to keeping bookmarks for a long time. My current/previous solution is to use browser bookmarks and to have them automatically sync. This is not ideal though, I can't easily sync between different devices (e.g. Firefox desktop to iOS Safari), so I have Firefox and Safari maintaining two separate databases in the cloud.

Typically, I bookmark a web page for one of these two reasons:

1. I think that I am going to need this for something that I have got on my mind, but I don't know when, if ever. Because I do not have a concrete action, this isn't going on my todo list.
2. In a very hand-wavey way, I think that might need to refer to this one day. I will hope to be able to find it by searching my bookmarks.

More recently, I've been testing [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com) (free tier), which better fits my use cases for bookmarking the web, but seems expensive to me. [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) looks great, and is much cheaper, and I may end up switching to this but I am not quite ready to pay for bookmarking yet. I do not bookmark stuff that much, I haven't worked out how I want it to fit into my new found indie-web thought process. Something I have never done is share my bookmarks and that's what I'm going to try here on my blog.

Expect more lists of links to come.
