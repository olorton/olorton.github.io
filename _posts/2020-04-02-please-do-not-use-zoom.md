title: Please do not use Zoom

Zoom is a video call/conference software that has become very popular of late. The prime minister has been seen using it, my family have asked to use it, colleagues want to use it; however, I will not, and I encourage you not to as well.

All software developers have a responsibility to protect their users' data, audio, and video leaking from systems they have designed. They also have a responsibility to ensure that the systems that they run on are not open to being attacked or compromised. Zoom have repeatedly shown that they do not care about doing this. I do not really understand why though, other than the privacy/security issues, they have usable and popular software. They could be very, very successful in the long term. I suspect, but have no evidence, that management team or product owners are not listening to the development team; or possibly, the development team is incompetent. Either way, something is very wrong at Zoom.

Here are a few examples of their behaviour:

* [Last summer - a security researcher pointed out that malicious websites could activate the user's webcam without the user's permission.](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5) Zoom would not agree that this was a security issue, instead claiming it was required to improve usability. Essentially, saying that usability is more important than security. Eventually, Apple had to step in an fix the vulnerability themselves.
* After pointing out the above issue, the security researcher had to decline the bug bounty payout because they wanted him to sign an NDA.
* [This month - a security researcher has disclosed that Macs are vulnerable to webcam and mic takeover again.](https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/01/new-zoom-bugs-takeover-macs-cam-mic-root/)
* [Zoom has been sending users activity to Facebook without their knowledge](https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/27/zoom-ios-app/), whether they have a Facebook account, or not. This feature/bug has now been removed, but not before the New York AG has started an investigation.
* [When installing Zoom on a Mac Zoom circumvents the standard installation process to install their software.](https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737672930824193) I believe that this is a flaw in the Apple installation system, and not really Zoom's responsibility; however, they choose to bypass it when they do not need to. Apple does need to take a look at this, they should be able to prevent Zoom from doing this.
* If you Windows users thought that only Macs were vulnerable to Zooms half-arsed approach to security, then you should be aware that the [Zoom Windows client is vulnerable to UNC path injection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zoom-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-run-programs-via-unc-links/).

I would love to go into the many issues with Zoom in more detail, but since I do not have time today, I think I'll leave you a list of other articles I have been reading on Zoom.
