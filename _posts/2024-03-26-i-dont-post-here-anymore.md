I dislike the act of publishing a blog post. I enjoy tending words, iterating, and gradually articulating an idea. This means I have a small selection of blog posts I have started and might never finish. I want to, but I won't. I wonder if I should convert this site to a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) or add a public notes section. I will have a think.

I have tweaked the design here though! Yellow usually looks awful on screens, but I quite like this shade combined with pink link highlights.
