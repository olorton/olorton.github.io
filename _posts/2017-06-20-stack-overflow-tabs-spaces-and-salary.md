A week or so ago the very clickbaity titled _Developers who use spaces make more money than those who use tabs_ was syndicated on Hacker News. Itâ€™s nice to see a ["correlation doesn't imply causation" rebuttal response to this by Evelina Gabasova](http://evelinag.com/blog/2017/06-20-stackoverflow-tabs-spaces-and-salary/)

TL;DR: The combination of open source contributions and version control system usage accounts for at least some of the difference in salaries between tab and spaces users
